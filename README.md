Running the scripts:

Step 1: html_to_csv
You will input the html files, and it will create a clean csv of the html

Step 2: powerset
This will put together all the activity data from the CSV file in a dataframe

Step 3: inferences_condition2
Take the output from step 2, and create the inferences as per the script.
There are several things here you want to consider/keep in mind:
Step 3.1 --> Select 4 datasets --> Any 4 dataset will work --> Try different combinations of the datasets
Step 3.2 --> For a given combination set from step 3.1, you will generate --> 3 inferences, 6 inferences, 9 inferences, 12 inferences
